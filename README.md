## Overview
The Real-Time Household Water Management System is an embedded IoT project designed to monitor and manage water usage in households. It provides real-time insights into water level, quality, and in/outflow rates. The system automates pump/valve operations, sends emergency notifications, and allows for manual overrides, ensuring efficient and safe water management.
## Features
Water Level Monitoring: Tracks the water level in the tank in real time.
Water Quality Detection: Measures water quality using sensors to ensure safe usage.
Inflow/Outflow Rate Tracking: Displays water usage rates.
Automation: Controls pumps and valves based on predefined thresholds.
Emergency Alerts: Notifies users via mobile/web interface during emergencies (e.g., overflows or contamination).
Manual Override: Allows manual control over pumps and valves.
Physical Shutdown Switch: Ensures safety in critical situations.
