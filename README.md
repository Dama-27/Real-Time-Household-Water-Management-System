# Real-Time-Household-Water-Management-System
## Overview
The Real-Time Household Water Management System is an embedded IoT project designed to monitor and manage household water usage. It provides real-time insights into water level, quality, and in/outflow rates. The system automates pump/valve operations, sends emergency notifications, and allows for manual overrides, ensuring efficient and safe water management.
## Features
- Water Level Monitoring: Tracks the water level in the tank in real-time.
- Water Quality Detection: Measures water quality using sensors to ensure safe usage.
- Inflow/Outflow Rate Tracking: Displays water usage rates.
- Automation: Controls pumps and valves based on predefined thresholds.
- Emergency Alerts: Notifies users via mobile/web interface during emergencies (e.g., overflows or contamination).
- Manual Override: Allows manual control over pumps and valves.
- Physical Shutdown Switch: Ensures safety in critical situations.
- Energy-efficient and cost-effective design.
