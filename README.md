# Smart Water Management System

## Overview
The **Smart Water Management System** is an embedded IoT project designed to monitor and manage water levels and flow rates in real time. This system automates pump and valve operations based on sensor readings, optimizing water usage efficiency and ensuring a sustainable water supply.

## Features
- **Water Level Monitoring:** Measures tank water levels using an ultrasonic sensor.
- **Inflow/Outflow Tracking:** Detects inflow and outflow using sensor inputs.
- Monitor **temperature**, and **TDS (water quality)**
- **Automated Control System:** Controls pumps and valves based on predefined thresholds.
- **Emergency Alerts:** Notifies users in case of water overflow.
- **Manual Override:** Provides users with manual control over valves and pumps.
- **Energy Efficiency:** Designed to optimize power consumption while maintaining efficiency.
- Receive real-time feedback via a **web-based dashboard**
- Expand future features such as **wireless sensors** and advanced analytics

## Components Used
- **Microcontroller:** ESP32
- **Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04):** Measures water level in the tank
- **Relays:** Controls water pumps and valves
- **Solenoid Valves:** Manages inflow and outflow of water
- **DS18B20 Temperature Sensor**
- **TDS sensor:** measure water quality

## Installation Guide
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Dama-27/Real-Time-Household-Water-Management-System.git
   cd Real-Time-Household-Water-Management-System
   ```
2. Connect the components as per the circuit diagram.
3. Upload the Arduino code to the microcontroller.
4. Open the Serial Monitor to observe sensor readings and system operations.

## How It Works
1. **Water Level Detection:** The ultrasonic sensor calculates the water level percentage in the tank.
2. **Pump and Valve Control:** Based on water level parameters, the system opens/closes valves and activates/deactivates pumps.
3. **Data Logging & Alerts:** The system sends alerts when thresholds are exceeded, ensuring proactive water management.

## Future Improvements
- Move to **wireless sensor modules** (e.g., LoRa, BLE) to reduce wiring complexity
- **Mobile App Integration:** Remote monitoring and control via a mobile app.
- **AI-based Predictive Analysis:** Smart decision-making based on usage patterns.
- **Solar Power Integration:** Enhancing sustainability with renewable energy sources.
