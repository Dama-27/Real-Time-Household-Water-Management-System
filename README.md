# Smart Water Management System

## Overview
The **Smart Water Management System** is an embedded IoT project designed to monitor and manage water levels, quality, and flow rates in real time. This system automates pump and valve operations based on sensor readings, optimizing water usage efficiency and ensuring a sustainable water supply.

## Features
- **Water Level Monitoring:** Measures tank water levels using an ultrasonic sensor.
- **Water Quality Detection:** Monitors Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) to ensure water safety.
- **Temperature Monitoring:** Tracks water temperature using a digital temperature sensor.
- **Inflow/Outflow Tracking:** Detects inflow and outflow using sensor inputs.
- **Automated Control System:** Controls pumps and valves based on predefined thresholds.
- **Emergency Alerts:** Notifies users in case of water overflow or contamination.
- **Manual Override:** Provides users with manual control over valves and pumps.
- **Energy Efficiency:** Designed to optimize power consumption while maintaining efficiency.

## Components Used
- **Microcontroller:** ESP32 or Arduino (Compatible with ESP-IDF and Arduino IDE)
- **Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04):** Measures water level in the tank
- **Dallas Temperature Sensor (DS18B20):** Measures water temperature
- **TDS Sensor:** Monitors water quality
- **Relays:** Controls water pumps and valves
- **Solenoid Valves:** Manages inflow and outflow of water

## Installation Guide
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Dama-27/Real-Time-Household-Water-Management-System.git
   cd Real-Time-Household-Water-Management-System
   ```
2. Install required libraries in the Arduino IDE:
   - OneWire
   - DallasTemperature
3. Connect the components as per the circuit diagram.
4. Upload the Arduino code to the microcontroller.
5. Open the Serial Monitor to observe sensor readings and system operations.

## How It Works
1. **Water Level Detection:** The ultrasonic sensor calculates the water level percentage in the tank.
2. **Temperature Measurement:** The Dallas temperature sensor reads real-time water temperature.
3. **TDS Monitoring:** The system detects water quality based on TDS sensor readings.
4. **Pump and Valve Control:** Based on water level and quality parameters, the system opens/closes valves and activates/deactivates pumps.
5. **Data Logging & Alerts:** The system sends alerts when thresholds are exceeded, ensuring proactive water management.

## Future Improvements
- **Integration with IoT Platforms:** Sending real-time data to a cloud dashboard.
- **Mobile App Integration:** Remote monitoring and control via a mobile app.
- **AI-based Predictive Analysis:** Smart decision-making based on usage patterns.
- **Solar Power Integration:** Enhancing sustainability with renewable energy sources.
